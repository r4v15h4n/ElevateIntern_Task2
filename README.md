Task 2 - Analyzing a Phishing E-Mail
Obtained a sample phishing email from NORTON.COM official website.This sample is about unusual sign-in activity on my microsoft account.
Carefully Examined senders e-mail address and it looks like a spoof e-mail address "no-reply_msteam2@outlook.com"
The e-mail contains a link for "reveiw recent activity", when I click that link it lands on login page which requires my microsoft ID and Password, and URL also doesnt look official microsoft website URL.
After carefully analysis found that the sender e-mail is not from official microsoft support.
the link for recent activity also not from microsoft itself.
so, this e-mail is a phishing e-mail.
